					  <h1>BUSINESS PLAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">
						If you are a CyberPark Business Line customer, the terms and conditions set out below will govern your use of the CyberPark Business Line services, and the contractual relationship between us in addition to the CyberPark General Terms and Conditions. If you receive other services from us, other terms may also apply to you. These terms may be found on our Web Site.
					</p>
					<h3>1. INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE</h3>
					<p>
						1.1 If required, we will arrange a time with you to install your CyberPark Business Line and you will make sure that we can access your property at this time.
					</p>
					<p>
						1.2 Additional charges may be incurred depending on the status of your current connection and you will be responsible for the payment of such charges.
					</p>
					<h3>2. EQUIPMENT</h3>
					<p>
						2.1 You will ensure that any equipment you connect to your CyberPark Business Line has a Telepermit printed on it or has been authorized for use by CyberPark. This helps make sure the equipment does not damage the network but does not mean that it will always remain compatible with the CyberPark network. If equipment which you use in connection with your CyberPark Business Line does not work properly, you will need to contact the equipment supplier or manufacturer, and not CyberPark, about the problem.
					</p>
					<h3>3. YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AND PORTABILITY</h3>
					<p>
						3.1 Any telephone number we or another telecommunication provider assigns to you will not be your property. You may port the number to another telecommunications service provider by contacting the provider to whom you wish to port such number. CyberPark will comply with its obligations under the Local and Mobile Number Portability Terms in relation to porting. You will be liable for any costs associated with transferring your service to another provider.
					</p>
					<p>
						3.2 We may change any number we have allocated and will give you reasonable notice of this. We will not be liable for any costs you incur as a result of such change. If you would like to change your telephone number please call CyberPark on 0800 2 29237.
					</p>
					<h3>4. OTHER SUPPLIERS AND OTHER SUPPLIER PRODUCTS</h3>
					<p>
						4.1 You are responsible for your relationship with any other supplier providing telecommunications services to you. For example, if you have a CyberPark Business Line but you have your internet services with another supplier, you must notify both us and the other supplier if you change your address.
					</p>
					<p>
						4.2 If you use the product of another service provider on the CyberPark network (for example, a teleconferencing service from another provider on your CyberPark Business Line) you may be charged for use of such product at a fee greater than that charged by the third party provider to its customers.
					</p>
					<h3>5. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
					<p>
						5.1 You agree that you will pay for repairing or replacing any part of the CyberPark network which is lost, stolen or damaged by you or anyone for whom you are responsible.
					</p>
					<p>
						5.2 You will make sure that any wiring or equipment at your premises, such as alarm systems, do not interfere with any part of the CyberPark network.
					</p>
					<p>
						5.3 You agree to make sure that every person for whom you are responsible (eg employees, contractors etc) also meets the responsibilities set out in this clause.
					</p>
					<h3>6. 0900 CALLS AND LOCAL CALLS</h3>

							Call charges for 0900 calls made from your telephone through the CyberPark network or charged to you, no matter who makes them
						</li>
						<li>
							Any charitable donations promised during those calls
						</li>
						<li>
							Any other amounts charged to you by the 0900 service providers. Your agreement to make these payments also applies for the benefit of the 0900 service providers and may be enforced by them.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						6.2 Local calling is free with your CyberPark Business Line provided you are on our LLU network (CyberPark Business plans) and you do not dial the local access code when making a local call. If you dial the local access code you will be charged at the relevant CyberPark Toll rate.
					</p>
					<h3>7. DIRECTORY LISTINGS</h3>
					<p>
						7.1 We will provide your details for the White Pages or its equivalent and for directory assistance by default. You agree that in relation to directory assistance services our liability is limited to seeking to rectify any error as soon as practicable.
					</p>
					<p>
						7.2 If you do not want your details to be listed in the White Pages or directory assistance, or you require special types of listings please contact CyberPark on 0800 2 29237. Any arrangement you make in relation to such listings however, will be an agreement between you and the directory services provider
					</p>
					<h3>8. WIRING AND MAINTENANCE</h3>
					<p>
						8.1 CyberPark's wiring and maintenance service is an optional service which covers the cost of fixing, during normal fault service hours, most faults in the telephone sockets and wiring inside your premises which are covered by the service. This service covers:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Telephone sockets and wiring which meet and are installed to our specifications
						</li>
						<li>
							Wiring inside your premises, but not external wiring to another building on your premises or from your premises to the network
						</li>
						<li>
							The service does not cover equipment attached to sockets such as extension cables or socket adapters
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						8.2 Moving, adding or changing sockets which are not faulty is not covered by this service. If we need to replace a socket to fix a fault we will replace it with an item from our product range which is similar. If you have a replacement item you would like us to install instead we will install it providing it meets with our requirements
					</p>
					<p>
						8.2 CyberPark's wiring and maintenance service does not cover you:
					</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

All calls that are forwarded under this service will incur call charges in the same way as if you had made an outbound phone call to the number being forwarded to. e.g. if you forward your number to a mobile phone, standard landline to mobile charges will apply.
					</p>

					</p>
					<p>
						11.2 In the event of continued non-payment we reserve the right to disconnect your phone where you will not be able to receive or place calls, including calls to emergency phone numbers. The line will continue to be charged at the normal monthly rate and a reconnection fee will apply.
					</p>

						11.3 If you have a medical condition or other special circumstance for which you require your telephone connection, it is your responsibility to let us know so we do not disconnect your phone line.
					</p>
					<h3>12. CALLER ID</h3>
					<p>
						If your CyberPark Plan includes our Caller ID product with your Business Line, we will provide this service on the landline you specify. For most incoming calls, Caller ID will display the phone number of the person calling you however your telephone and/or wall socket need to be compatible in order to receive the Caller ID Service. Some incoming calls will not display the number for example where a call is made from a line which has an unlisted number or from a pay phone or another service provider’s network. If you intend to collect or use any calling information provided by the Caller ID product you must comply with the Privacy Act 1993. You agree that you intend to use Caller ID to help identify the calling party, and to call back a phone number displayed or stored on telephone. You will ensure that everyone using your phone, or the numbers displayed on your display screen, understands and meets these responsibilities.
					</p>

					<p>
						13.1 A toll call is any call you make that is not a local call (e.g. national, international and calls to mobile phones). All CyberPark toll calls are subject to a one minute minimum charge. Calls longer than one minute duration are rounded up to the next minute.
